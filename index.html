        <p>Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed file system enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. It achieves high performance by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going to disk to load datasets that are frequently read.
        </p>

        <p> On April 10th, 2013, we put out a <em>soft</em> release of <a href="https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Tachyon-Release-0.2">Tachyon 0.2.0</a> Alpha. The new version is more stable and also features performance improvements. It is, however, a soft release and we are working full time towards a full <em>hard</em> release that contains a stable version of the features that we expect will be core to Tachyon. Stay tuned.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Features: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Java-like File API:</b> Tachyon's native API is similar to JAVA file, providing <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html">InputStream</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html">OutputStream</a> interface, and efficient support for memory mapped I/O. Using this API would get best performance from Tachyon</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Compatibility:</b> Tachyon also implemented Hadoop FileSystem interface, therefore, Hadoop MapReduce and Spark can run with Tachyon without modification. However, close integration is required to fully take advantage of Tachyon and we are working towards that. End-to-end latency speedup depends on the workload and the framework, since various frameworks have different execution overhead.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Native support for raw tables:</b> Table data with hundreds or more columns is common in data warehouses. Tachyon provides native support for multi-columned data. The user can choose to only put hot columns in memory.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Pluggable underlayer file system:</b> Tachyon checkpoints in memory data into the underlayer file system. Tachyon has a generic interface to make plugging an underlayer file system easy. It currently supports HDFS, and single node local file system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Web UI:</b> Users can browse the file system easily through web UI. Under debug mode, administrators can view detailed information of each file, including locations, checkpoint path, etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Command line interaction:</b> Users can use <em>./bin/tachyon tfs</em> to interact with Tachyon, e.g. copy data in and out of the file system.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Framework Close Integrations</h3>
        <p>As being mentioned at the beginning, current Tachyon is still in its developer preview release.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shark</li>
          <li>Spark</li>
          <li>MapReduce</li>
          <li>Frameworks on top of MapReuce, such as Hive, Pig</li>
        </ul>
